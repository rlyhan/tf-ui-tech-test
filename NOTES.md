# 📝 Design Notes — Richard Han

> Fill this in when you're done. Bullet points are fine — keep it concise.

* Info banner - underlined text to indicate a link, lighter orange background 
* Hero
    * Stronger weight title text
    * Subtitle that summarises what this tour should “feel” like
    * CTA with yellow background to match existing CTAs, labelled “Explore private tours” so visitor is immediately directed to the list of different holidays 
* What is private touring section
    * Description is expandable, showing a brief overview that the visitor can choose to read, or just scroll down to get more info
    * Box listing features of private touring, uses off-white background colour to contrast
* Private Tours / Destinations Sections
    * Uses different styles of cards
    * Private Tours uses a larger card (image, title, subtitle, description, price, CTA) to give user enough information 
    * Destinations uses a smaller card style (title, image, CTA) as there is less content and we want to try show several on this page
* Why Book with Trailfinders section
    * Information box with gentle off-white background to show information that can be carefully read
* Enquire section
    * Simple strong brand colour background in its own box to stand out
    * Copy styling from previous version but add more spacing

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

**Format chosen (desktop or mobile)** — *Which did you pick and why?*

- I chose mobile, because people more often have access to a phone than a computer, and if they hear about Trailfinders they could quickly open the site on their phone to gauge some info
- On mobile, there is less space for above the fold content, so there needs to be careful thought in terms of content, layout and sizing so the visitor is immediately engaged with the page’s meaning and also not overwhelmed
- Starting with mobile ensures we are avoiding potential chaos of having to fit large amounts of content and complex layouts on desktop into mobile

**Colour palette** — *What did you choose and why does it suit Trailfinders as a brand?*

- I chose to stick with the colours that define the brand (orange, dark gray, white) to keep familiarity with a long existing brand
- Orange: I used it for CTAs and image card headings because it is the primary brand colour, and when people view options and click to the next product, it keeps a memory of what brand they are looking at
- Dark gray / White: Used it for background colours for page sections and image cards, allowing them to alternate between text/background colour to help distinguish sections 
- Black: Complements the main colours well
- Off-white: Used to indicate informative content and complements the main colours well, I consider it a more stand-out yet gentle replacement for the previous version's light gray

**Typography** — *What fonts did you use and why?*

- Trebuchet MS - existing font on the site, just kept it as it is gentle on the eyes
- Georgia - existing hero font, used it for various headings as it has an elegant look that resonates with older audiences and a trustful feel for a travel company

**Layout & section order** — *Did you change the order of the sections? Why did you structure it this way?*

- I kept the "What is private touring" in the same position but allowed the text to be expanded as it was currently too long and doesn't give you a peek at the rest of the content
- I moved "Why book Trailfinders" below the "Destinations" section as I wanted the list of tours (ie. the Japan image) to peek above the fold, which I feel is more engaging so the user can immediately see what options they have rather than have to go through lots of reading

**Anything else worth noting** — *A specific design choice you made that you want us to see and understand.*

- I updated the background colours of the sticky footer (orange) and the information banner (off-white) to help them blend better into the new theme
- I added an underline to the information banner text as it was not obvious that it was a link

## 🧍 Who You Were Designing For

*Who is the user arriving at this page? What do they already know, and what do they need to understand or feel by the end of it?*

- I designed it for a combination of users - those of an older audience, people who were referred to Trailfinders as they are a reputable brand, people looking specifically looking to do private tours, and new users
- What they already know is that Trailfinders is a trusted and popular brand, whether they came from the homepage as someone more unfamiliar with the brand or knew about them through word of mouth
- What they must understand about the page by the end is what a private tour is, what different options they have, and how they can learn more information about private tours, tours for specific destinations, and the next step towards booking one

## 🔁 What I'd Improve With More Time

*What would you iterate on, refine, or add?*

- Hero has more potential for contrast, which can be achieved through different font styles, text shadows, text inside boxes, etc
- Potential for more balance through making spacing more even or larger
- Having access to more icons could help communicate certain sections better and make the layout far more cleaner/scannable
- The off-white background colour, while is good for communicating being "informative" and is easy to read, may not work that well for sections like "Why book a private tour with Trailfinders?" which might need more stronger brand colour to make a stronger brand-related statement --- I would look at adding different variants for background colour such as the primary theme orange
- Different sections not part of the brief can be incorporated in between some sections to add balance, including Trustpilot reviews, which quickly lets users know they are in good hands
- Enquire section could use better distinction in terms of each contact option (could use icons, different colours, more CTAs, etc)
